00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 We're gonna get started now with some of our rapid start modules which is designed to get you

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,760
 rapidly started. You're gonna be seeing a lot of me throughout the course so I thought I'd hand it

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,520
 over to Archer who is one of our experienced mentors and student advisors. He's gonna take you

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,040
 through some of these very important modules to start with and then you'll see me a lot more,

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:28,000
 a lot more in the rest of the course so I'll see you soon. Thanks Justin and hi. As Justin said,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,520
 my name is Archer. I'm an eyehand study mentor and student advisor and my job is to really make

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,480
 sure that you get the most out of this course. If you're able to learn a lot and succeed that

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,600
 means that we've done our job. When you win, we win and so it's my job to get you there. To get

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,000
 you started I want to let you know about some of the most important techniques that every single

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,200
 student on this course should know about. Without these, winning is going to be a very long and

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,760
 tiring struggle. If you have ever felt like you've never had enough time or you have a really busy

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,120
 day and despite that you get nothing actually important done then these techniques are going

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,040
 to help you fix that. If you're able to use some of these techniques you'll notice that the time

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,680
 that you spend will be more meaningful. You're able to be more motivated and it would actually give

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,080
 you the time you need to focus on the other skills that we'll be teaching throughout this course.

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,920
 But what you'll realize is or maybe you already realize is that if you don't work on the skills

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,600
 you need to become more efficient now early on it may be too late by the time that you need it.

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,880
 Sometimes investing time into something now is going to be that thing that saves you time later

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,800
 on. After all we've always known that efficiency is a key factor of creating success. I'm reminded

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:45,040
 of a quote from Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Company and what he said is that if I had asked

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,400
 people what they really wanted they would have asked for faster horses. And I think this really

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,160
 summarizes how often we can get so invested in what we have right now that we don't even think

23
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,880
 about the change that could change the game entirely. I'm sure that the people who are laying

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,880
 roads for the horses, making better horse saddles or finding the better ways of grooming a horse

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,240
 would have been far too busy to build a car. So if you're really busy with studying and trying to

26
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,800
 learn using the current techniques that you have, you're so busy that you can't even work on the

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,080
 course then that is the biggest sign that you even have to work on this course even more.

28
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,760
 If we're too busy with what doesn't work we'll never have time to learn what does work. And I can

29
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,560
 guarantee you that if you change nothing, nothing will change. You can't solve the problem the same

30
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,520
 way that you created the problem. So let's get into a few quick modules to get you building your car,

31
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:52,640
 fixing the problem and changing what needs to be changed.
